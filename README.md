In this project, I created an AR-based indoor navigation Android mobile application, iNav, using Android SDK and Vuforia SDK which is Qualcommâ€™s AR platform for implementing AR features. Google Maps API is also used for displaying a more interactive indoor map. Using iNav, user can scan a nearby room number to obtain his or her current location and view the location on an indoor map along with some extra information including room title, image, and detailed description about this room. After the user enters a destination room number at the search bar, iNav will show both current and destination locations on the map and display the detailed room description of the destination.An administration web site has also been created to allow administrators of iNav to add or update the building and room information.
